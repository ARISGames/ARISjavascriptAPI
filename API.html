Callbacks
These are functions you can define in your javscript that ARIS will call externally

ARIS.didUpdatePlayerItemQty(updatedItemId,qty)
//Description: if defined in your javascript, ARIS will call this function to let you know of the result of any item transactions (For example, if you say "give 5", it will call this function with the new qty so you can see if in fact 5 were given, or the newly set qty was clamped to maxQuantity)
//Arguments:
//  updatedItemId: the id of the item for which there is new information
//    example: 51295 (find the ID for the item in the editor)
//  qty: the most up-to-date quantity of the item_id specified
//    example: 5

ARIS.ready()
//Description: if defined in your javascript, ARIS will call this function as soon as the ARIS->webview->js pipeline has been fully established and is ready to go.
