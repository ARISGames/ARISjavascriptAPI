Leaderboard
=================

leaderboard.html and leaderboard_fancy.html are examples of a simple leaderboard in ARIS.

For a specific game, it will display all the usersâ€™ current inventory quantity of a single item, and sort them from highest to lowest. 

To configure, modify the game_id and item name in the first few lines of code.
