ARISjsExamples
=================

ARIS has a rich .js API we call ARISjs. ARISjs allows you to create interactive HTML5 content that connects with the client, player and current game being played.

This repository is for ARISjs users to post and share code that will help others get up to speed. If you have something to share, please send us a pull request with a new directory containing your project and a REAME.md to explain itâ€™s use.

Full documentation for ARISjs is available at the ARIS Manual at http://manual.arisgames.org/editor/arisjs
