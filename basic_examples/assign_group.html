// Hey! Read this please!
//
// Any text to the right of a // is a "comment".
// That is, it won't be interpreted as code, and can be used to explain things.
// Feel free to delete any/all comments from the code you use (but leaving them in won't cause any harm)
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// This example simply assigns a group, and then gives that group an item via javascript.
// Note: this functionality exists in native ARIS- Just use an Event.
// The purpose of this example code is to illustrate the group-assigning/giving API
// around which you might build a more complex shell that justifies the use of JS.
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Update the text 'GroupA' with the name of the in-ARIS group you'd like to assign the player to.
// Update the group_id value (currently '2' in the example).
// NOTE: Must be done explicitly, as the functionality to derive id from name is not yet in ARISjs
// Update the text 'SimpleItem' with the name of the item you'd like to give to the group

var ARIS = {};
ARIS.ready = function()
{
  var group_name = 'GroupA';
  var group_id = 2; //not *yet* derivable via 'getGroupForName'

  var item_name = 'SimpleItem';
  var item_id = ARIS.cache.idForItemName(item_name);

  ARIS.setGroup(group_id);
  ARIS.giveGroupItemCount(item_id,1);
}
