// Hey! Read this please!
//
// Any text to the right of a // is a "comment".
// That is, it won't be interpreted as code, and can be used to explain things.
// Feel free to delete any/all comments from the code you use (but leaving them in won't cause any harm)
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// This example gives an item if one condition is met, and takes it if the condition is not met.
// It is unlikely that you'd use this specific example, as many of the values are arbitrary.
// Some basic understanding of javascript would hopefully render this example more useful.
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Change the text 'SimpleItem' to the name of the in-ARIS item you'd like to conditionally give or take.
// Currently, the logic is as follows:
//   If you have less than 5 qty of this item, it will give you 1 qty
//   Otherwise, it will take 1 qty
// You can change the '5' below to any threshhold you'd like
// You can also change the first '1' (which specifies the amount to give assuming the threshhold is not met)
// and you can change the second '1' (which specifies the amount to take assuming the threshhold is met)
// But more likely, you'd like to change the whole structure
// (what is the requirement that dictates whether or not a thing is given or taken?)
// (how ought ARISjs behave assuming this requirement is met or not?)
// But this, as stated before, would require some basic knowledge of javascript.

var ARIS = {};
ARIS.ready = function()
{
  var item_name = 'SimpleItem';
  var item_id = ARIS.cache.idForItemName(item_name);
  var current_qty = ARIS.cache.getPlayerItemCount(item_id);

  if(current_qty < 5) //the condition- "is current qty < 5?"
  {
    ARIS.givePlayerItemCount(item_id,1); //if the condition is met, do this
  }
  else
  {
    ARIS.takePlayerItemCount(item_id,1); //otherwise, do this
  }
}
