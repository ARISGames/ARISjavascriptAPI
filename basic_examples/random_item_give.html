//
// DESCRIPTION:
// Give a random item from a list of possible items.
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Change the text:
//   'SimpleItemA',
// to:
//   'The Name of One of Your Items',
//
// (repeat for 'SimpleItemB', etc...)
//
// Note that you must retain the ''s on either side of the name of your item, and the trailing ,
// You can add as many lines as you'd like (as different items from which it randomly chooses)
// You can also remove any lines (so long as there is at least one)
//
// Also, change the 1 to the qty of the randomly chosen item you'd like to give.
// (If you know some javascript, you might even be able to randomly choose the qty!)
