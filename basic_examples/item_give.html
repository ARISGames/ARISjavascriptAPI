// DESCRIPTION:
// This example simply gives an item.
// Note: This functionality exists in core ARIS- just use an Event.
// This is meant to just show the give item API, as an example from which to build a more complex js shell.
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Change the text 'SimpleItem' to the name of the item you'd like to give.
// Change the 1 to the amount you'd like to give.

  var item_name = 'SimpleItem';
  var item_id = ARIS.cache.idForItemName(item_name);
  ARIS.givePlayerItemCount(item_id,1);
