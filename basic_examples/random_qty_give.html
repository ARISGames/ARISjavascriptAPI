// DESCRIPTION:
// Gives, takes, or sets a random quantity (between minQty and maxQty) of an item to a player.
// (defaults to "sets")
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Change the text 'SimpleItem' to the name of the item you'd like to give.
// Change the 1 after var minQty = to the number representing the minimum you'd like to possibly give/take/set (inclusive)
// Change the 10 after var maxQty = to the number representing the maximum you'd like to possibly give/take/set (inclusive)
// If you'd like to "give" this random amount, uncomment the mode = "give" line (that is, delete the preceding //)
// If you'd like to "take" this random amount, uncomment the mode = "take" line (that is, delete the preceding //)
// If you'd like to "set" this random amount, uncomment the mode = "set" line (that is, delete the preceding //)
