<script type='text/javascript'>

// Hey! Read this please!
//
// Any text to the right of a // is a "comment".
// That is, it won't be interpreted as code, and can be used to explain things.
// Feel free to delete any/all comments from the code you use (but leaving them in won't cause any harm)
//
// DESCRIPTION:
// This example displays some info about the player.
// You might use this to reference the player by name (or show them their player_id, etc...)
// Basic knowledge of string concatenation in javascript may be required for this example to be useful.
//
// INSTRUCTIONS:
// The line with "Player's id:"... sets the text that will appear to the user.
// You are free to alter this to make it say whatever you'd like-
// but you need to conform to javascript's string concatenation rules.
//
// Some quick examples (note that this will replace the right of the = on the line starting with player_info_el.innerHTML =):
// To simply explicitly define the text to be shown, you can write:
//
// "Hello! This text will be shown.";
//
// (note the quotes surrounding the text, and the semicolon at the end)
// This will display as:
//
// Hello! This text will be shown.
//
// You can concatenate (combine) strings (quote-surrounded bits of text) with a +
// If you write:
//
// "Hello!" + "This text will be shown.";
//
// This will display as:
//
// Hello!This text will be shown.
//
// (note the lack of a space between Hello! and This- any characters you want in the final text must be within the quotes)
// Finally, you can also concatenate variables (here, we have user_name, display_name, and user_id).
// If you type:
//
// "Hello, " + display_name + "! Or should I call you " + user_name +"?";
//
// It will display (assuming the user's display name is Fred and their user name is ARISGamer123):
//
// Hello, Fred! Or should I call you ARISGamer123?
